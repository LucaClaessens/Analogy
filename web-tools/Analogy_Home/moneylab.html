                </h4>
                <h4>
                The MoneyLab had been experiencing what is a common problem among publishers. They could no longer sustain their publishing model. They simply did not have enough financial means to send every book that they produced to the printing press.
                In our test case with the Moneylab we’ve decided to use a combination of our three trademark methods in order to create an interactive setup that would enable users to publish a list of suggestions for relevant new themes and predictions on the fields the event was focused on. 
                </h4>
                <h4>
                By creating a publishing installation at the event itself, Moneylab was able to generate, edit and produce an entire set of publications on the spot, while making use of well-known techniques such as Neural Networks, Crowdsourcing and a Freemium sales model, all techniques pioneered by the winners of the industry such as Facebook, Google and Spotify.

                <p>We aggregate information based on the needs of a publishing enterprise, be that involved with books, event, exhibitions. To do so, we require access to the content produced by the enterprise. We’re equipped to scrape and compile additional information on the fly. </p>
                <p>This source material will be ran through a set of algorythms and eventually be compiled into a dataset suitable for machine learning purposes; we grow a set of unique networks from scratch for every use case, ensuring suitable content can be produced. </p>

                <h3>Outsourced Design</h3>
                <p>We possess a vast array of options to pick from in terms of outsourcing the Design component of the process. From outsourcing to machines, to crowdsourcing platforms, to a simple file conversion, or all of these at once and others, the key component of our design strategy is that there should be almost no design work necessary, of course, for as close to zero spending as possible. </p>
                <h3>Ad-Sponsored Printing</h3>
                <p>Where neccesary, we can employ tactics garnered from a big chunk of the big media outlets out there, additional to the original data we can embed advertising, at either embedded or native level into the product, paying for part of the production process.<em> </em>be warned, not every publication is suitable for this setup!</p>

                <h3>Smart Sales &amp; Distribution</h3>
                <p>The main objective of our process is, of course, to make sure the publication makes it into the hands of readers and generates revenue. For this, we employ an array of different techniques similar to those of established online platform models such as Spotify. Some options that we advise our clients to consider are the use of the Freemium model, different types of Paywalls, generating revenue party through Advertising and monetising through taking advantage of all the Data generated by the company.</p>
                <p>Since no company is the same, we create personalised strategies by devising the best combination of models for each specific client.</p>
